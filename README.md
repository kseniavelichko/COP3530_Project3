# COP3530_Project3
In order to run this project you need to go to the IMDB data set at https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+title_principals.csv
Download the csv files. In particular we used IMDb movies.csv, IMDb names.csv, and IMDb title_principals.csv
There are two files to represent our two separate graph implementations. We chose to keep them separate for cleaner code, as we implemented our graphs using different methods when obtaining data from the dataset
